# StPaulsCathedralAR
StPaulsCathedralAR is an augmented reality application developed as a project for the Computer Graphics course in 2020.

Apk file is avaliable on the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PJuZHHws0t83KOZ4YXf0xTI3y9mfSM87/view?usp=sharing

## Model

The model of the St. Paul's Church is designed in Blender. The church was modeled without it's surrounding buildings, to provide clear perception of the model to the user. The coloring scheme used was provided by my colorful imagination, since the exact model had no happy colours which made the designer(me) slightly timid.

## Application

Augmented reality application is developed using Unity3D. The application displays 3D content based on Image recognition. The Unity plugin Vuforia was used, as it supports most of modern devices. Scripts for object manipulation on the scene are written in C#.

Points of interest (POI) are designed in accordance with its content. For gallery POI is a holy grail (a golden object on top of the roof), for audio it is a statue of Jesus Christ on the top of the church and for interesting facts, it is a book.

## How to use the application?

To use the application your device must be one of the recommended devices as stated in this article: https://library.vuforia.com/platform-support/vuforia-engine-recommended-devices.html

After downloading and installing the application, on the first run you will need to allow the application to use your camera and storage. You will see camera area with icons (as shown below) and you just need to scan the marker image, the image you can find in the repository, to see the 3d model and points of interest.
